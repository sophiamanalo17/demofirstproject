		<p style="font-family: helvetica;">A little bit about me: I am an IDM student at NYU, but I am originally from San Diego, California. My hobbies inlclude working on projects (right now I am building a lamp in the makerspace), baking (I love to bake guava linzer cookies), and also most recently, writing (which you can find below). Anyway, in the future I hope to persue UX design/research and am very excited to learn web development. My favorite movies include The Grand Budapest Hotel and Little Women (2019). I recently have also enjoyed reading and listening to audio books, like Crime and Punishment and The Portrait of Dorian Gray. I also had a wonderful winter break, and am excited for the new year!</p>
